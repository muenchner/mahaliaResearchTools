% Example calculations to demonstrate using optimization to choose a set of k damage maps and corresponding ground-motion intensity maps, each with a corresponding adjusted annual rate of occurrence, from a set of J candidate maps that provides a good representation of the earthquake hazard and performance risk. These calculations are based on the following paper:

%This code requires CVX with the Gurobi solver. More details for installation into Matlab including license information (free for academic use) is available at: http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/gurobi.html
%Note: a common problem with installation is that you get an error, "Gurobi MEX file could not find Gurobi License". If this error occurs, here is what you do to solve it. In the process of the instructions linked above, you run cvx_grbgetkey in Matlab with the proper license code. The result is that Gurobi and Matlab download a license file. If the license is not detected when you type cvx_setup in Matlab (as part of the instructions linked above), the license may be in the wrong location and/or have the wrong name. What to do? Figure out what your home directory is by typing getenv('userprofile') in Matlab. Then, move the downloaded license file (as described earlier in this paragraph) to this home directory. Finally, rename the file to gurobi.lic. The result is that when you call cvx_setup again from Matlab, it should work. Still have issues? Email support@cvxr.com. If you have trouble after that, you can email me at mahaliakmiller@gmail.com.

%(c=1 per event), which are the percentage of bridges damaged
%example_data: annual rate of occurrence for each of the damage maps
