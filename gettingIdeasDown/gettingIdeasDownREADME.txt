I'd recommend Latex for writing papers. You can download this as a bundle. Check out Latex for the impatient here: http://latex-project.org/ftp.html

There are some fun programs for running Latex other than TeXShop for Mac that I use. However, that's a good start if you are using a Mac (and consider TexMaker otherwise). If you are really hard core, you may want to just edit everything in Sublime Text, an all-purpose file editor, and then "compile", i.e. make the pdf and references and such, in a Latex program.

You can also make presentations with Latex. The main advantage is that you can just copy and paste the equations from your papers. Research shows that you can create compelling visuals if your work is aligned, which is easy with this program. The disadvantages? Few people use this program so it's harder to share slides, and furthermore, many people feel that it's easier to work on the artistic/aesthetic parts of preparing a visual presentation in Powerpoint or Keynote.

So, the other two natural options are Microsoft Word and Microsoft Powerpoint. Keynote is another presentation software alternative. Choose what suits you and your collaborators!

One note on Latex: I put the figures in a separate folder at a directory level higher than the main paper and presentation files. Why? It makes it easier when you want to share pictures between presentations and papers. Also, if you write a thesis comprising multiple papers, you'll need this central place.

So, where to get started? First, download and install Latex (see above). After that, look at the map_selection.tex file in the samplePaper folder. Then, look at sample_beamer_mahalia.text file in the samplePresentation folder. The result is you'll get a head start on some Latex best practices. Finally, you can start learning more from the web and from other people.
