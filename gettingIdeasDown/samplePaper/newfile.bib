	abstract = {Two key issues distinguish probabilistic seismic risk analysis of a lifeline or portfolio of structures from that of a single structure. Regional analysis must consider the correlation among lifeline components or structures in the portfolio, and the larger scope makes it much more computationally demanding. In this paper, we systematically identify and compare alternative methods for regional hazard analysis that can be used as the first part of a computationally efficient regional probabilistic seismic risk analysis that properly considers spatial correlation. Specifically, each method results in a set of probabilistic ground motion maps with associated hazard-consistent annual occurrence probabilities that together represent the regional hazard. The methods are compared according to how replicable and computationally tractable they are and the extent to which the resulting maps are physically realistic, consistent with the regional hazard and regional spatial correlation, and few in number. On the basis of a conceptual comparison and an empirical comparison for Los Angeles, we recommend a combination of simulation and optimization approaches: (i) Monte Carlo simulation with importance sampling of the earthquake magnitudes to generate a set of probabilistic earthquake scenarios (defined by source and magnitude); (ii) the optimization-based probabilistic scenario method, a mixed-integer linear program, to reduce the size of that set; (iii) Monte Carlo simulation to generate a set of probabilistic ground motion maps, varying the number of maps sampled from each earthquake scenario so as to minimize the sampling variance; and (iv) the optimization-based probabilistic scenario again to reduce the set of probabilistic ground motion maps.

This model comprises a time-independent (Poisson-process) earthquake rate model, developed jointly with the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Program and a time-dependent earthquake-probability model, based on recent earthquake rates and stress-renewal statistics conditioned on the date of last event. The models were developed from updated statewide earthquake catalogs and fault deformation databases using a uniform methodology across all regions and implemented in the modular, extensible Open Seismic Hazard Analysis framework. The rate model satisfies integrating measures of deformation across the plate-boundary zone and is consistent with historical seismicity data. An overprediction of earthquake rates found at intermediate magnitudes ({6.5≤M≤7.0)} in previous models has been reduced to within the 95\% confidence bounds of the historical earthquake catalog. A logic tree with 480 branches represents the epistemic uncertainties of the full time-dependent model. The mean {UCERF} 2 time-dependent probability of one or more M≥6.7 earthquakes in the California region during the next 30 yr is 99.7\%; this probability decreases to 46\% for M≥7.5 and to 4.5\% for M≥8.0. These probabilities do not include the Cascadia subduction zone, largely north of California, for which the estimated 30 yr, M≥8.0 time-dependent probability is 10\%. The M≥6.7 probabilities on major strike-slip faults are consistent with the {WGCEP} (2003) study in the San Francisco Bay Area and the {WGCEP} (1995) study in southern California, except for significantly lower estimates along the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults, owing to provisions for larger multisegment ruptures. Important model limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {The flow capacity of a transportation network can be reduced significantly if its constituent bridges are damaged by natural or man-made hazards. For rapid risk-informed decision making on hazard mitigation and response, it is therefore essential to have a capability to predict the post-hazard flow capacity of the network efficiently and accurately. However, this is a challenging task due to the uncertainty in hazards and structural damage, and the complex nature of the network flow analysis. Moreover, the bridge structures may experience significant deterioration over their life cycle, which requires time-varying network reliability analysis. This paper proposes a new non-sampling-based approach to estimate the time-varying post-hazard flow capacity of a bridge transportation network considering structural deterioration of bridges. The proposed approach evaluates the probabilities of structural damage scenarios efficiently using the matrix-based system reliability method and rapidly computes the corresponding flow capacities using a maximum flow capacity analysis algorithm. The matrix-based framework facilitates the integration of these results to obtain the probabilistic distributions and statistical moments of the network flow capacity. It also enables computing various measures useful for risk-informed decision making, such as the conditional mean and standard deviation of flow capacity given observed structural damage, and component importance measures. In the proposed approach, probability calculation and network flow analysis are performed separately, which renders time-varying post-hazard flow capacity analysis efficient. The proposed approach is demonstrated by a numerical example based on the Sioux Falls network under multiple bridge-deterioration scenarios simulating the progress of deterioration.},

	abstract = {The prediction of possible future losses from earthquakes, which in many cases affect structures that are spatially distributed over a wide area, is of importance to national authorities, local governments, and the insurance and reinsurance industries. Generally, it is necessary to estimate the effects of many, or even all, potential earthquake scenarios that could impact upon these urban areas. In such cases, the purpose of the loss calculations is to estimate the annual frequency of exceedance (or the return period) of different levels of loss due to earthquakes: so-called loss exceedance curves. An attractive option for generating loss exceedance curves is to perform independent probabilistic seismic hazard assessment calculations at several locations simultaneously and to combine the losses at each site for each annual frequency of exceedance. An alternative method involves the use of multiple earthquake scenarios to generate ground motions at all sites of interest, defined through {Monte–Carlo} simulations based on the seismicity model. The latter procedure is conceptually sounder but considerably more time-consuming. Both procedures are applied to a case study loss model and the loss exceedance curves and average annual losses are compared to ascertain the influence of using a more theoretically robust, though computationally intensive, procedure to represent the seismic hazard in loss modelling.},

	abstract = {A novel approach and framework for the analysis of bridge networks is presented. The goal of the analysis is to assess the life-cycle performance of the network and its time-variant reliability. The proposed approach combines three important features that determine its ability to estimate with accuracy and robustness the reliability of a network along its life-cycle. The first one is that the reliability of the individual bridges is modeled as time-variant, due to the deterioration of their structural components. The network performance analysis is repeated for several time instants, with the relative reliability of the bridges. Therefore, the network performance indicators are also time-variant. In this way, the proposed procedure can be used as a basic tool for maintenance planning at the network level. The second asset is that the proposed framework takes into account complex (i.e. “generalized”) network layouts, not necessarily describable using series, parallel or series-parallel models. In fact, when all the possible traffic flows in a network and all the possible trip origins and destinations are considered, it is not feasible, in general, to model the network with a simple scheme. In the present paper, techniques derived from transportation engineering for the traffic flow distribution and assignment are used. The third feature is that the proposed approach considers a correlation structure among the states (in/out of service) of the various bridges of the network. In fact, bridges associated with the same network are likely to share similar characteristics and external loads. Therefore, a correlation structure for the service state of individual bridges is estimated and implemented in the analysis. A case study involving a transportation network with fourteen bridges is presented as a numerical application.},

	abstract = {Risk assessment of spatially distributed building portfolios or infrastructure systems requires quantification of the joint occurrence of ground-motion intensities at several sites, during the same earthquake. The ground-motion models that are used for site-specific hazard analysis do not provide information on the spatial correlation between ground-motion intensities, which is required for the joint prediction of intensities at multiple sites. Moreover, researchers who have previously computed these correlations using observed ground-motion recordings differ in their estimates of spatial correlation. In this paper, ground motions observed during seven past earthquakes are used to estimate correlations between spatially distributed spectral accelerations at various spectral periods. Geostatistical tools are used to quantify and express the observed correlations in a standard format. The estimated correlation model is also compared with previously published results, and apparent discrepancies among the previous results are {explained.The} analysis shows that the spatial correlation reduces with increasing separation between the sites of interest. The rate of decay of correlation typically decreases with increasing spectral acceleration period. At periods longer than 2 s, the correlations were similar for all the earthquake ground motions considered. At shorter periods, however, the correlations were found to be related to the local-site conditions (as indicated by site Vs30 values) at the ground-motion recording stations. The research work also investigates the assumption of isotropy used in developing the spatial correlation models. It is seen using the Northridge and Chi-Chi earthquake time histories that the isotropy assumption is reasonable at both long and short periods. Based on the factors identified as influencing the spatial correlation, a model is developed that can be used to select appropriate correlation estimates for use in practical risk assessment problems.

Based on this finding we propose a network of road usage by defining a bipartite network framework, demonstrating that in contrast to traditional approaches, which define road importance solely by topological measures, the role of a road segment depends on both: its betweeness and its degree in the road usage network. Moreover, our ability to pinpoint the few driver sources contributing to the major traffic flow allows us to create a strategy that achieves a significant reduction of the travel time across the entire road system, compared to a benchmark approach.},

	abstract = {Recent earthquake disasters have caused major damage to transportation networks, leading to significant economic disruption. While this suggests the need to evaluate total system performance in transportation risk assessment, in addition to examining the vulnerability of individual components such as bridges, no appropriate measures currently exist. This paper develops post-disaster system performance measures and applies them to the urban rail and highway transportation systems in the Kobe, Japan, region devastated by the 1995 {Hyogoken–Nanbu} earthquake. Performance is evaluated in terms of network coverage and transport accessibility. Performance degradation was much more severe for highways and railways than for other lifeline infrastructure systems. Both transportation systems fared poorly in the disaster but service restoration proceeded much more rapidly for rail. The restoration of highway system performance correlated closely with the recovery of highway traffic volumes. The paper further develops a measure of subarea transport accessibility and applies this to Kobe’s constituent city wards. Results indicate substantial spatial disparity that is maintained throughout the restoration period. Comparisons with the 1989 Loma Prieta and 1994 Northridge earthquakes in the {US} show that although these disasters caused notable damage to highway bridges, system performance degradation was small in comparison with the Kobe experience. The paper argues that explicitly measuring transportation system performance can greatly facilitate both understanding the effects of historic disasters and preparing for future hazard events.},

Using geographic information systems ({GIS)} and graphical visualization, analytical models were created for the city and its underlying infrastructure.

Using {GIS} software, inventories of the possibly affected infrastructure were made at different {SLR.} Results of the analysis show that low {SLR} would lead to a minimal loss of city area. Damages to the local properties, however, are estimated at an assessment value of at least {US\$2} billion based on only the direct losses of properties listed in real estate databases, without accounting for infrastructure damages that include military installations, residential areas, governmental property, and cultural institutions.

In this paper, we describe a heuristic, based on convex optimization, for approximately solving this problem. Our heuristic gives a subset selection as well as a bound on the best performance that can be achieved by any selection of k sensor measurements. There is no guarantee that the gap between the performance of the chosen subset and the performance bound is always small; but numerical experiments suggest that the gap is small in many cases.

This study was limited to identifying the populations served by these local plans.  As of mid-August 2005, 51 of the 58 state entities had local plans.  This documentation review revealed there were only 1139 of the congressionally mandated local approved plans with 5793 participating jurisdictions representing only 37.44\% of the nation's population.  Ten state entities' local approved plans covered 69\% or greater of the state's population and only five out of that ten were able to achieve of 88\% or greater.  The lower quartile's performance pre-Katrina and post-Katrina is examined. The low adoption rate, whether caused by multiple philosophies, misinterpretations or limited local capacity, capability, competence or support, must be determined by more in-depth research.  However, it was noted that the Pre-Disaster Mitigation ({PDM)} program guidance was more focused on pre-disaster mitigation strategies and competitive cost-effective projects then all-hazards risk and vulnerability assessments.  To determine if a local or state {PDM} project will be cost-effective and maximize the benefits to the Nation, these assessments must be completed first for all local counties and all hazards.},

Regional analysis must consider the correlation among lifeline components or structures in the portfolio, and the larger scope makes it much more computationally demanding. In this paper, we systematically identify and compare alternative methods for regional hazard analysis that can be used as the first part of a computationally efficient regional probabilistic seismic risk analysis that properly considers spatial correlation. Specifically, each method results in a set of probabilistic ground motion maps with associated hazard-consistent annual occurrence probabilities that together represent the regional hazard. The methods are compared according to how replicable and computationally tractable they are and the extent to which the resulting maps are physically realistic, consistent with the regional hazard and regional spatial correlation, and few in number. On the basis of a conceptual comparison and an empirical comparison for Los Angeles, we recommend a combination of simulation and optimization approaches: (i) Monte Carlo simulation with importance sampling of the earthquake magnitudes to generate a set of probabilistic earthquake scenarios (defined by source and magnitude); (ii) the optimization-based probabilistic scenario method, a mixed-integer linear program, to reduce the size of that set; (iii) Monte Carlo simulation to generate a set of probabilistic ground motion maps, varying the number of maps sampled from each earthquake scenario so as to minimize the sampling variance; and (iv) the optimization-based probabilistic scenario again to reduce the set of probabilistic ground motion maps.

By taking the gradient of the topography and choosing ranges of slope that maximize the correlation with shallow shear-velocity observations, we can recover, to first order, many of the spatially varying features of site-condition maps developed for California. Our site-condition map for the low-relief Mississippi Embayment also predicts the bulk of the {VS30} observations in that region despite rather low slope ranges. We find that maps derived from the slope of the topography are often well correlated with other independently derived, regional-scale site-condition maps, but the latter maps vary in quality and continuity, and subsequently, also in their ability to match observed {VS30} measurements contained therein. Alternatively, the slope-based method provides a simple approach to uniform site-condition mapping. After validating this approach in regions with numerous {VS30} observations, we subsequently estimate and map site conditions for the entire continental United States using the respective slope correlations.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic seismic risk assessment for spatially distributed lifelines is less straightforward than for individual structures. While procedures such as the {‚ÄòPEER} framework‚Äô have been developed for risk assessment of individual structures, these are not easily applicable to distributed lifeline systems, due to difficulties in describing ground-motion intensity (e.g. spectral acceleration) over a region (in contrast to ground-motion intensity at a single site, which is easily quantified using Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis), and since the link between the ground-motion intensities and lifeline performance is usually not available in closed form. As a result, Monte Carlo simulation ({MCS)} and its variants are well suited for characterizing ground motions and computing resulting losses to lifelines. This paper proposes a simulation-based framework for developing a small but stochastically representative catalog of earthquake ground-motion intensity maps that can be used for lifeline risk assessment. In this framework, Importance Sampling is used to preferentially sample ‚Äòimportant‚Äô ground-motion intensity maps, and K-Means Clustering is used to identify and combine redundant maps in order to obtain a small catalog. The effects of sampling and clustering are accounted for through a weighting on each remaining map, so that the resulting catalog is still a probabilistically correct representation. The feasibility of the proposed simulation framework is illustrated by using it to assess the seismic risk of a simplified model of the San Francisco Bay Area transportation network. A catalog of just 150 intensity maps is generated to represent hazard at 1038 sites from 10 regional fault segments causing earthquakes with magnitudes between five and eight. The risk estimates obtained using these maps are consistent with those obtained using conventional {MCS} utilizing many orders of magnitudes more ground-motion intensity maps. Therefore, the proposed technique can be used to drastically reduce the computational expense of a simulation-based risk assessment, without compromising the accuracy of the risk estimates. This will facilitate computationally intensive risk analysis of systems such as transportation networks. Finally, the study shows that the uncertainties in the ground-motion intensities and the spatial correlations between ground-motion intensities at various sites must be modeled in order to obtain unbiased estimates of lifeline risk.

	abstract = {The deteriorating state of highway bridges is traditionally ignored in estimating the seismic reliability of transportation networks. In this study, the present day seismic reliability of ageing bridges in highway networks is evaluated through a time-dependent seismic fragility analysis of typical bridge classes. An efficient algorithm based on finite-state Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations is also presented to assess the reliability of large ageing highway bridge networks without the need to simplify the network topology. The criticality of ageing bridges is then assessed through different proposed ranking strategies to arrive at an optimised seismic retrofit prioritisation. A case study on an existing bridge network with 515 bridges in the state of South Carolina, {USA} reveals striking differences between results of the proposed ranking strategies and those from state-of-the-practice methods. Such differences emphasise the significance of accounting for network-level importance in seismic retrofit programs of ageing transportation networks.},

The magnitude of the correlation depends on the distance between the sites and the natural vibration periods of the structures. This study investigates the spatial correlation of the peak ground motions and the pseudospectral acceleration ({PSA)} responses using the California records and the Chi-Chi records. Because the correlation arises from interevent and intraevent variability, the correlations for individual variability alone and for the combined variability are assessed. The analysis results indicate that the spatial intraevent correlation decreases as the separation distance increases and that the magnitude of the correlation of the {PSA} responses depends on the considered natural vibration periods. The results also indicate that the spatial intraevent correlation of the {PSA} responses for the California records decays more rapidly than that for the Chi-Chi records. Based on the analysis results, a simple empirical equation to predict the spatially varying correlation coefficient of the {PSA} responses, which can be employed in seismic-hazard and seismic-risk assessments, is proposed.},

In our approach, fault rupture is represented kinematically and incorporates spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture speed, and rise time. The prescribed slip distribution is constrained to follow an inverse wavenumber-squared fall-off and the average rupture speed is set at 80\% of the local shear-wave velocity, which is then adjusted such that the rupture propagates faster in regions of high slip and slower in regions of low slip. We use a Kostrov-like slip-rate function having a rise time proportional to the square root of slip, with the average rise time across the entire fault constrained empirically. Recent observations from large surface rupturing earthquakes indicate a reduction of rupture propagation speed and lengthening of rise time in the near surface, which we model by applying a 70\% reduction of the rupture speed and increasing the rise time by a factor of 2 in a zone extending from the surface to a depth of 5 km. We demonstrate the fidelity of the technique by modeling the strong-motion recordings from the Imperial Valley, Loma Prieta, Landers, and Northridge earthquakes.},

It focuses on natural disaster risk, but also discusses the management of terrorism risk. A unique feature of this book is the involvement of three leading catastrophe modeling firms, {AIR} Worldwide, {EQECAT}, and Risk Management Solutions, who examine the role of catastrophe modeling in rate setting, portfolio management and risk financing. Using data from three model cities (Oakland, {CA}, Long Beach, {CA} and {Miami/Dade} County, {FLA)}, experts from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania examine the role of catastrophe modeling to develop risk management strategies for reducing and spreading the losses from future disasters. Given the uncertainties associated with terrorism the book points out the opportunities for utilizing catastrophe models to set insurance rates and to examine public-private partnerships for providing financial assistance in the event of a terrorist attack.   {"This} book fills a critical need in setting forth the role of modern risk analysis in managing catastrophe risk. There is no comparable reference work for this important subject area. The book is well written and well organized. It contains contributions from many of the most distinguished experts in the fields of risk analysis and risk management.

Earthquakes, blackouts and satellite failures have evidenced the vulnerability of these growing networked systems threatening the continuity of the United States' economy. The potential for malicious perturbations to these systems is also an important current concern. However, the underlying susceptibility of these networks to disruptive events is in large part due to the increasingly complex pattern of interdependencies that tie these civil infrastructures together. This paper mainly investigates the effect of seismic disruptions on the performance of real interdependent networks. Maintenance-induced malfunctions and coordinated attacks are also studied for completeness. Several degrees of interconnectedness are explored. Interdependent network fragility curves are introduced to display the effect of these different strengths of coupling. Characterization of the performance displayed by the networks is utilized to propose mitigation actions and study propagation of their effects. It is shown that minimal strategic interventions propagated through the network can generate a more resilient interdependent entity. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Large tropical cyclones cause severe damage to major cities along the United States Gulf Coast annually. A diverse collection of engineering and statistical models are currently used to estimate the geographical distribution of power outage probabilities stemming from these hurricanes to aid in storm preparedness and recovery efforts. Graph theoretic studies of power networks have separately attempted to link abstract network topology to transmission and distribution system reliability. However, few works have employed both techniques to unravel the intimate connection between network damage arising from storms, topology, and system reliability. This investigation presents a new methodology combining hurricane damage predictions and topological assessment to characterize the impact of hurricanes upon power system reliability. Component fragility models are applied to predict failure probability for individual transmission and distribution power network elements simultaneously. The damage model is calibrated using power network component failure data for Harris County, {TX}, {USA} caused by Hurricane Ike in September of 2008, resulting in a mean outage prediction error of 15.59\% and low standard deviation. Simulated hurricane events are then applied to measure the hurricane reliability of three topologically distinct transmission networks. The rate of system performance decline is shown to depend on their topological structure. Reliability is found to correlate directly with topological features, such as network meshedness, centrality, and clustering, and the compact irregular ring mesh topology is identified as particularly favorable, which can influence regional lifeline policy for retrofit and hardening activities to withstand hurricane events.},

The minimization problems of the potential energy and the complementary energy for incremental analysis are then formulated as the primal-dual pair of {SOCP} problems, which can be solved with a primal-dual interior-point method. To enhance numerical performance of tracing an equilibrium path, we propose a warm-start strategy for a primal-dual interior-point method based on the primal-dual penalty method. In this warm-start strategy, we solve a penalized {SOCP} problem to find the equilibrium solution at the current loading step. An advanced initial point for solving this penalized {SOCP} problem is defined by using information of the solution at the previous loading step.},

After reviewing the basic theory of {SOCPs}, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as {SOCPs.} These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving {SOCPs}, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming ({LP):} Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

	abstract = {Security of energy supply is a main concern worldwide, given the strong dependence on society functioning on its adequate delivery. Surges in fuel prices, political conflicts, wars and natural disasters threaten directly energy supply, and countries look at ways to protect themselves. On February 2010 an 8.8 Richter scale earthquake hit the central part of Chile and a tsunami following the earthquake hit coastal areas, affecting the most populated area of the country. Main supplies collapsed, electricity, water, gas, telephones, contributing to make matters worse for the suffering population. This paper illustrates events that took place in electricity supply during and after the earthquake in Chile, its impact on the generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, and the lessons to be learned. The challenges in reconstruction are also discussed. The main interconnected system, generation and main transmission grid, was able to resume partial operation within a few hours, although in a weak condition. Damage took place in some main substations, and alternative paths and operational conditions had to be found. Security criteria had to be degraded in the system operation and handling of the main grid. The Chilean codes impose strict anti seismic standards for all electricity infrastructure construction, but the earthquake strength still produced damage in some grid installations. However, the most severe damage took place in the distribution networks, vast areas were left with no supply for weeks, including the large city of Concepcion being severely affected.},

	abstract = {Civil infrastructure systems, such as water, electrical power, natural gas, and transportation systems, are essential to the smooth functioning of modern society. Because of their inter-connected nature, once one infrastructure system is damaged by an earthquake or other natural hazard, other infrastructure systems may malfunction as well. A number of previous studies have assessed vulnerability of infrastructure systems to earthquakes, but seldom have failures due to infrastructure system interactions been considered. In its assessment of the earthquake-induced damage of a municipal water system, this paper includes the impact of damage to the supporting electrical power system using a fault tree analysis and a shortest-path algorithm. The effect of uncertainty of seismic intensity and component fragility on network integrity is evaluated. A case study involving a simple model of the electrical power system and water system in Shelby County, {TN}, which includes the city of Memphis, demonstrates the importance of taking infrastructure interactions into account when evaluating the seismic vulnerability and risk to a networked system, as well as the utility of back-up power systems in electric power facilities.},

	doi = {10.3141/2202-21},
	abstract = {Multispan continuous steel girder bridges are one of the most common bridge types in the central and southeastern United States. Seismic fragility curves for these highway bridges are essential for risk assessment of highway transportation networks exposed to seismic hazards. This study focuses on developing and comparing fragility curves for seismically and nonseismically designed bridges that are common in this region. The primary differences between seismically and nonseismically designed bridges are the column details and bridge bearings. Detailed three-dimensional (3-D) nonlinear analytical models, which account for the nonlinear behavior of the column, girders, and abutments, are developed with the use of the {OpenSees} platform. The fragility curves are developed with a suite of ground motions representative of the seismic hazard in the region. Unlike most previous studies, the fragility curves are developed with geometric variations such as column height, deck width, and length considered to study the effect of these variations on the fragility curves within the same class of bridges. The results provide insight into the level of uncertainty introduced in the analysis of fragility curves for portfolios of bridges with the use of 3-D analytical models and nonlinear time-history analyses. Component and system fragility curves are obtained and are compared for the case of nonseismically and seismically designed bridges.},

	abstract = {Arias intensity, Ia, has been identified as an efficient intensity measure for the estimation of earthquake-induced losses. In this paper, a new model for the prediction of Arias intensity, which incorporates nonlinear site response through the use of the average shear-wave velocity and a heteroskedastic variance structure, is proposed. In order to estimate the effects of ground motions on spatially-distributed systems, it is important to take into account the spatial correlation of the intensity measure. However, existing loss-estimation models, which use Ia as an input, do not take this aspect of the ground motion into account. Therefore, the potential to model the spatial correlation of Arias intensity is also investigated. The empirical predictive model is developed using recordings from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center Next Generation of Attenuation database whereas the model for spatial correlation makes use of the well-recorded events from this database, that is the Northridge and Chi-Chi earthquakes.
