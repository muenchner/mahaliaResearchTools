============

This repository offers code and tools to enable you to become a more efficient researcher. The five main categories are:  finding references, getting your ideas down, making pretty pictures, researching natural disasters with finesse, and synchronizing your data.

This work has been done primarily by me in the Baker Research Group at Stanford University, USA. Here is our group website: http://stanford.edu/~bakerjw/

Here's the summary:

1. Finding references: Chrome, Zotero, Bibtex (+links to other good options)

2. Getting your ideas down: Latex, Beamer, Powerpoint

3. Making pretty pictures: Matlab functions, ArcGIS, Illustrator, Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib

4. Researching natural disasters with finesse: Choosing a subset of earthquake scenarios with optimization, Modeling networks quickly (more coming soon)

5. Synchronizing your data: Dropbox, Box, Github
