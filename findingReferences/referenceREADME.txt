First, you will want to install the following three programs:
Zotero 
Chrome (or Safari or Firefox)
Chrome Extension for Zotero (or equivalent or "standalone")

Then, surf for a reference in scholar.google.com. With the above three programs installed, you'll see an icon in your web browser address bar that looks like a piece of paper or folder. CLick on this and the reference will be added to Zotero.

Then, in Zotero, you can organize your references. You'll want to export to bibtex if you want to use Latex. If you want to use Word, take a look at this video: https://www.zotero.org/support/screencast_tutorials/zotero_and_word.


Here is a great little video showing you how to get data into Zotero: https://www.zotero.org/support/screencast_tutorials/getting_stuff_into_zotero

Here are some screenshots explaining how to get stuff from Google Scholar specifically: https://www.zotero.org/support/screencast_tutorials/zotero_and_google_tools

Note: there are other alternatives to Zotero. One good option is Papers for Mac. You may also consider Endnote. You can consult the web for other choices.
